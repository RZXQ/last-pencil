## Work on project. Stage 1/5:Empty the pencil case

Project: [Last Pencil (Java)](https://hyperskill.org/projects/341)

## Empty the pencil case

## Description

You and your friend decided to play a simple pen-and-paper game. There's one catch â€” you have only pencils but no paper;
the last piece of paper is gone for your beautiful drawings. As a joke, your friend pulls all the pencils out of the
case onto the table and says: "Your turn!"

## Objectives

In this stage, your program should print two lines: one line with several vertical bar symbols representing pencils (for
example, `|||` or `|||||||`) and one `Your turn!` string.

## Examples

**Example 1:**

```no-highlight
||||||||
Your turn! 
```

**Example 2:**

```no-highlight
|||
Your turn!
```
